<h1>Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer.</h1>

<p>I care deeply for nature. It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence.</p>

<p>Well, what do you expect, mother? Guy's a pro. Really? <strong> Did nothing cancel?</strong> <em> Whoa, this guy's straight?</em> I hear the jury's still out on science.</p>

<h2>I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.</h2>

<p>Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish.</p>
